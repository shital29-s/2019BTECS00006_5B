<center><h1>The joint-family spirit helped IPL 2021 survive the pandemic and remain the world’s most successful domestic T20 league</h1></center>
<br>
<p>The contribution of the cricketers’ families to the unparalleled success of the 2021 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) could be seen by the televised effusion of joy among the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) players’ spouses and children in the wake of Dhoni’s team winning on Friday, October 15, 2021, the tournament whose organisers defied all odds by ensuring that the show went on in the UAE after the second phase of the pandemic struck the Indian heartland in April-May.</p>
<p>In an environment where everyone is wise after the event and the blame game takes up so much of the mind space, the organisers of the 2021 edition of the IPL deserve to be congratulated for making a success of the world’ biggest domestic T20 league at a time when the entire tournament was on the verge of getting derailed when the pandemic struck in April-May.</p>
